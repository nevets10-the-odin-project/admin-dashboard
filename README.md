## Introduction

Now that youâ€™ve had plenty of practice using Grid, we are going to build a full dashboard design. For this project, use whatever tools you need to get it done, but try to lean on Grid for the majority of the layout work. Go back through the lessons or practice assignments if you need a refresher.

## Post project reflection

Not too sure on the color choice, but I'm just gonna roll with it.

The box-shadows were a pain because the gap between the project cards and the aside elements was cutting off the project card's shadow. So I had to ultimately convert the gap to padding.

This is also the first project that I've done on my Windows machine instead of the Xubuntu VM. A hand full of issues were cropping up with Virtual Box, so I decided to drop it so I could focus on the project. I tried to setup a dual boot, spent hours on setting it up to only run into a problem that seemed to be out of my hands which ended up breaking the Xubuntu boot process. So I'm just going to stick with Windows for now.
