## Post project reflection

Not too sure on the color choice, but I'm just gonna roll with it.

The box-shadows were a pain because the gap between the project cards and the aside elements was cutting off the project card's shadow. So I had to ultimately convert the gap to padding.

This is also the first project that I've done on my Windows machine instead of the Xubuntu VM. A hand full of issues were pissing me off with Virtual Box. I tried to setup a dual boot, spent hours on setting it up to only run into a problem that seemed to be out of my hands which ended up breaking the Xubuntu boot process. So I'm just going to stick with Windows for now.
